Transition to organic dairy farming implies changes in management, including the prohibition of the use of antibiotics for mastitis control, which could potentially impact udder health. As a result, more research is needed to better understand mastitis epidemiology on organic dairies and identify new ways to mitigate these risks. The objectives of this study were to investigate the relationship between presence and persistence of intramammary infections (IMI) in the first 35 days in milk and somatic cell count and milk production during the first 6 months of lactation in first-lactation organic dairy cows. This study provides important information that could be used to improve the utility of IMI screening in early lactation heifers on organic dairy farms.
